**ðŸ˜ŽInspirationðŸ˜Ž**
If you ever wondered whatâ€™s the point of vacation, is it all fun or are there real benefits? Vacations are fun, but they also have numerous benefits such as decreasing depression, lowering the risk of heart disease, improving productivity, etc. Despite these benefits, 51% of the US population havenâ€™t taken a vacation in a full year because they donâ€™t get a time off. This inspired me to create Vacation it, a website that helps people find a splendid vacation, to take the time off and enjoy.

	**ðŸ˜‰What it DoesðŸ˜‰**
Itâ€™s a website to help plan your next vacation. You can find vacation to go to, find hotels and flights based on your budget and it asks questions to pick the best vacation possible if you arenâ€™t sure on where to go. For example, it asks what temperature,climate and budget, then finds the place you want to go based on the info given. Unlike other websites, this website learns about you and predicts future vacations that you might go on., and it will find deals for it. It includes features such as Spotify, disconnect mode, which will disable the phone for a set amount of time to help you to take breaks when needed,vacations to see vacations that have gone before, and a fun mode which will help to relieve stress from work.
